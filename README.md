# Data-Warehousing-and-Analytics
# This project aims to investigate the correlation between graffiti prevalence and the quality of city sanitation services across various community districts in New York City.
# The project utilized several tools across different phases. Google BigQuery served as theprimary database, enabling efficient storage and querying of the transformed data. The dbt(Data Build Tool) was employed for the ETL process, allowing seamless data transformations and ensuring the data was analytics-ready. The programming languages SQL and Python wereused for querying and preliminary data profiling, respectively. For data visualization, Tableau was  used to create interactive dashboards and generate insightful KPI visualizations. Finally,the hosting environment for the project was Google Cloud, which provided a scalable and secure infrastructure for data storage and processing.
